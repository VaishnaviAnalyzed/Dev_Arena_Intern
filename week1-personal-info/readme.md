# Personal Information Manager

A simple Python command-line application that displays stored profile data and collects user preferences to generate a personalized summary. This project was created as part of my Week 1 programming milestones.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Display:** Shows hardcoded profile information (Name, Age, City, Hobby).
- **Calculations:** Automatically calculates your age in months.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures the user provides an answer for their favorite food and color.
- **Clean UI:** Uses formatted headers and dividers for a better terminal experience.
